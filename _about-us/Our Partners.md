<h2><strong>Our Adult Educators</strong></h2>
<p>At SSI we believe in developing talents to shine with altruism. We encourage
and facilitate professional growth for our Adult Educators (AEs) and continuously
build a solid and lasting partnership with them.&nbsp; We stand committed
to evolve stronger as a family. In mind with our prime mission to create
trends, explore possibilities and inspire compassion.</p>
<h3><strong>Why join the Adult Educators pool?</strong></h3>
<p>AEs who partner with SSI can look forward to opportunities to take on
different roles. There are various engagement mediums and professional
development opportunities in place to encourage AEs’ continuous professional
growth, active engagements and interactions, and a providence of a quality
feedback pool with SSI.</p>
<h4><strong>Apply to be our Adult Educator</strong></h4>

<h3><strong>Adult Educators Recognition</strong></h3>
<p>SSI values the contribution of our AEs in the social service sector and
have a system in place to honour their efforts.</p>
<h4><strong>Growing Together to Impact as One</strong></h4>

<h2><strong>Partnership Opportunities</strong></h2>
