<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
<p>Training Network Model 2.0 (TNM 2.0) is a 5-year strategic project that
aims to transform up to 7 SSAs to become Centres of Excellence.</p>
<p>The objective of TNM 2.0 is to build a sustainable learning ecosystem
for the social service sector, while helping enhance the capabilities and
capacity of the 7 SSAs so that they, as domain experts, can offer training
and consultancy services to the sector as well.</p>

<h3><strong>Selected SSA as Partners for TNM 2.0</strong></h3>
<p>7 SSA partners were selected based on their domain expertise, proven track
record, buy-in from management and board, as well as their readiness to
conduct training. SSA partners select one Primary Training Area, based
on their domain expertise, to specialise in. SSA partners were encouraged
to offer training in secondary training areas as well.</p>
<p>Details of each SSA are available on their websites.</p>
