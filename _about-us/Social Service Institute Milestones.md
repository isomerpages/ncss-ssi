</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Launch of SSI’s SGUnited Skills Programmes (SGUS) which are aimed at helping
170 Singaporeans/PRs impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic to find suitable
employment in the social service sector. The three SGUS programmes under
SSI are: the Social Service Accelerator programme targeted at re-skilling
individuals who are assuming corporate functions and fund raising roles
in SSAs, the Volunteer Management programme targeted at re-skilling individuals
to be Volunteer Managers and Coordinators, and the Social Service Assistant
programme targeted at re-skilling individuals to be Social Service Assistants
and Programme Assistants. A total of 113 of applicants were received for
all three programmes, while 53 were confirmed as part of the first cohort.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To respond to capability development needs in the midst of the COVID-19
pandemic, SSI collaborated with Meta Consulting to pilot a microlearning
initiative. This one-year pilot is called the NEXLeaders Programme and
it aims to develop the leadership and management capabilities of social
service professionals. Each learner under this programme is provided with
a 12 month access to over 60 bite sized courses that they can access anytime-anywhere
from their mobile devices. This pilot tested the readiness of SSAs and
funding agencies for subscription based learning. At the end of FY20, SSI
achieved 560 subscribers from about 120 organisations. From a survey conducted,
out of 280 respondents, 97% of them rated the pilot positively and 96%
mentioned that they will strongly recommend this programme to their colleagues.</p>
