<h2>Overview: Advanced Certificate in Social Service Course</h2>
<p>The Advanced Certificate in Social Service is a foundational programme
that aims to equip learners with the necessary knowledge and skills to
be collaborative, client-centric, compassionate and resilient individuals
who are able to carry out their roles effectively when working with clients,
partners and stakeholders. The programme further equips learners with the
knowledge, skills and attitudes required in para-counselling. This allows
them to provide service support to various clients and when working with
volunteers in social service agencies (SSAs), communities and institutional
settings.</p>
<p>The qualification obtained from completing this foundational programme
will promote the development and enhancement of horizontal skills necessary
to perform the role of a Social Service Assistant. There are five WSQ modules
and five non-WSQ modules in this programme. Successful completion of the
programme will provide learners with the academic/qualification pathway
to progress further in their journey to upskill themselves. Graduands from
this programme will be eligible to apply for the SSI Higher Diploma in
Social Service (HDSS), which articulates to the Bachelor of Social Work
programme offered by the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS).
