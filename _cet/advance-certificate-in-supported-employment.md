<p>This module will equip learners with the necessary skills and knowledge
of case management in practice. It provides learners with a broad understanding
of how case management serves as a means for achieving client wellness

<h4><strong>Module 4: Conflict, Leadership and People Management</strong></h4>

<br><strong>Assessment date:</strong> 27 September 2024</p>
<p>Conflict is an issue that people have to manage regularly. Any efforts

have to recognise and accept that potential conflicts may be inevitable.
If conflict is not effectively managed and resolved, it can be detrimental
because it can cause uncertainty, lower morale and hurt long-term working
efficiency and effectiveness. This module will discuss conflict resolution,
the art of negotiation in reaching an agreement between different stakeholders
as well as how to apply the principles of leadership and people management.</p>

<p>This module focuses on the role and responsibilities of a professional
job coach and coaching techniques for persons with disabilities (PWDs)
within a supported employment framework. In contrast to the traditional
train-and-place approach, job coaching in supported employment embraces
a ‘place, train and sustain’ model which requires job coaches to work closely
with clients with disabilities and employers throughout the job coaching
process. Learners will acquire specific knowledge and skills to engage
and support clients and employers in supported employment which includes
the development of client profile, job development and placement, job site
training and support, and fading out and follow-up.</p>
