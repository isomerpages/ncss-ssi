If conflict is not effectively managed and resolved, it can be detrimental because it can cause uncertainty, lower morale and hurt long-term working efficiency and effectiveness. This module will discuss conflict resolution, the art of negotiation in reaching an agreement between different stakeholders as well as how to apply the principles of leadership and people management.

In contrast to the traditional train-and-place approach, job coaching in supported employment embraces a ‘place, train and sustain’ model which requires job coaches to work closely with clients with disabilities and employers throughout the job coaching process. Learners will acquire specific knowledge and skills to engage and support clients and employers in supported employment which includes the development of client profile, job development and placement, job site training and support, and fading out and follow-up.
