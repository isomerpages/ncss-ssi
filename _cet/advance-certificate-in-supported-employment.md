**Module 1: Supported Employment and Working with Clients of Different Disabilities**  
(9 - 16 February 2023)

This module will equip learners with a better understanding of the concept and practices of Supported Employment, including techniques to provide guidance to clients with disabilities in their career planning, employment laws and grants available for employers and persons with disabilities.  
  
**Module 2: Basic Counselling Skills and Practice for Job Coaches**  
(16 - 18 May 2023)

This module provides an overview of the counselling process, the different roles performed by the job coach-counsellor, basic counselling skills, goals of counselling, values and ethics in counselling and approaches in problem management.  In addition, this module will also cover barriers of communication in the counselling process and ways to prevent communication breakdown when working with clients.   
  
**Module 3: Introduction to Case Management**  
 (2 - 3 March 2023)
	
This module will equip learners with the necessary skills and knowledge of case management in practice. It provides learners with a broad understanding of how case management serves as a means for achieving client wellness and autonomy through advocacy, dialogue, identification of service resources and direction. Additionally, the workshop also helps learners in forming the connections between job coach, client, service personnel and other stakeholders in order to optimize the assistance rendered.  
  
**Module 4: Conflict, Leadership and People Management**  
(10 - 11 April 2023)

Conflict is an issue that people have to manage regularly. Any efforts in equalising and normalising persons with disabilities at workplace would have to recognise and accept that potential conflicts may be inevitable. If conflict is not effectively managed and resolved, it can be detrimental because it can cause uncertainty, lower morale and hurt long-term working efficiency and effectiveness. This module will discuss conflict resolution, the art of negotiation in reaching an agreement between different stakeholders as well as how to apply the principles of leadership and people management. 
  
**Module 5: Client and Employer Engagement**  
(24 April 2023 - 3 May 2023)

This module focuses on the role and responsibilities of a professional job coach and coaching techniques for persons with disabilities (PWDs) within a supported employment framework. In contrast to the traditional train-and-place approach, job coaching in supported employment embraces a ‘place, train and sustain’ model which requires job coaches to work closely with clients with disabilities and employers throughout the job coaching process. Learners will acquire specific knowledge and skills to engage and support clients and employers in supported employment which includes the development of client profile, job development and placement, job site training and support, and fading out and follow-up.  
  
**Compulsory Visit to Enabling Village – This will be conducted after the completion of the last Module. More details will be advised in class**
