## Overview: Higher Diploma in Social Service

SSI’s Higher Diploma in Social Service (HDSS) is a programme for new entrants and existing Social Service Professionals who aspire to be Social Work Associates. The programme aims to equip learners with the necessary skills and knowledge to be collaborative, client-centric, strategic and compassionate individuals who can work effectively with clients and stakeholders. 

The programme covers a wide range of concepts, which includes human behaviour, family life cycles, psychology, sociology and culture, and their application in working with vulnerable clients and stakeholders. In addition, the programme will also cover writing and presentation skills, usage of online information, research methodologies and legal frameworks to help the vulnerable. 

Successful applicants will also be required to attend an Academic Integrity Workshop and participate in a Social Service Field Experience to better prepare them for the programme and help them in their learning journey. 

SSI’s HDSS programme also provides an articulation pathway into Bachelor in Social Work at the Singapore University of Social Services (SUSS), for learners who want to pursue a further education and their aspiration to become a Social Worker.
