GatherHere is an online community for the Social Service Tribe, a group of like-minded individuals, who share a vision of empowering everyone to live with dignity. It is where members of the Social Service Tribe can come together to work, communicate, network and reach out differently.

### Social Service Agencies & Non-Profit Organisations   
Office communication systems such as emails tend to be unidirectional and are not conversational and collaborative in nature. In this aspect, GatherHere operates on a social-first policy, with an interface that is based on social media sites. This encourages a culture of innovation, communication and collaboration.

Through GatherHere, you can create organisation specific communication networks. This allows for the creation of official organisation-based work communities in place of “unofficial group chats” such as in WhatsApp or Telegram. Unlike both platforms, newcomers to GatherHere community groups will also have access to past posts and conversations and will be assigned a social group to help them connect with the rest of the employees in the organisation.
   
This makes GatherHere ideal for the creation of interconnected community groups that are able to work together in a communication and collaboration focused environment.
