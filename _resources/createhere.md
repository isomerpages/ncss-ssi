Algorithms for most social media platforms are geared towards photos and videos. In fact, digital marketers have stated that videos increase the probability of someone buying your services, cause or mission by up to 97%!

With CreateHere, social service agencies and professional interest groups now have access to a media production studio with simplified operating requirements that is still capable of creating video content in half the time and cost that is associated to conventional video production.

Through CreateHere, complex information can be presented as a short video, which allows for the information to be more readily understood in a more engaging manner. Afterall, a two minute video that is anchored on audio and sensory based content is more likely to generate shares than a long e-mail explaining the details.

Coupled with the relevant support systems to create quality video content, CreateHere users do not need to go through tedious technical processes, or engage the help of experts to create a video!
