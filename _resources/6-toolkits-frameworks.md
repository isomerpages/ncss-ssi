---

The Skills Framework (SFw) for Social Service was launched in January 2019 at the SSI Graduation & Awards Ceremony by then Minister of State for Social and Family Development and Foreign Affairs, Mr Sam Tan.   
   
Jointly developed by SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG), Workforce Singapore (WSG), the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) and the National Council of Social Service (NCSS) together with industry associations, training providers and organisations, the framework provides useful information on:
- Sector information.
- Career pathways.
- Occupations and job roles.
- Existing and emerging skills.
- Training programmes for skills upgrading and mastery.   
   
It aims to help existing and aspiring social service professionals, social service agencies, as well as training providers identify key skills and competencies that are necessary to stay future-ready and better help those in need. Through the framework:   
   
**Individuals** who wish to join or progress within the social service sector can assess their career aspirations, identify relevant training programmes to upgrade their skills and prepare for their desired job roles.   
   
**Social service agencies** will be able to identify relevant skills and invest in training their employees for career development and skills upgrading.   
   
**Training providers** can gain insights on sector trends, existing and emerging skills that are in demand and design programmes to address the industry needs accordingly.
