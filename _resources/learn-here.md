## LearnHere
LearnHere is an online platform that hosts a variety of learning based content. It was created to complement formal classroom trainings and provide an online portal for social service professionals to access learning-based content readily while balancing the requirements of a full time job.

Specifically, LearnHere offers both e-Learning that is hosted on our Learning Cloud platform and blended learning content, which involves a blend of more than one type of learning (e.g. a blend of traditional face-to-face learning in the classroom and online learning).

Through a blended learning approach, learning can happen before a learner enters the classroom, allowing for more effective use of classroom time for deeper discussions with our adult educators and their peers.

### Benefits of LearnHere for Learners
Through LearnHere, Learners can:
- Learn on-the-go, with access to learning anytime and anywhere!
- Learn at their own pace, with unlimited access to materials and discussions.
