<p>The technology and the infrastructure found in SSI’s classrooms are based
on the SMILE concept:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>S- Simplicity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>M- Mobility</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I- Intelligence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>L- Learning collaboration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>E- Empowerment</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This creates a smart learning environment that allows for a more interactive
and productive learning experience for our learners.</p>
<p>Components of SSI’s smart learning environment include gadgets like a
“digital” pen that captures, records and digitalises handwriting in real
time and an auto-tracking camera that senses and follows an Adult Educator’s
(AE) movements during lectures which enable real-time recording and sharing
of educational content.</p>
<p>In SSI, both our learners and AEs are empowered to leverage on our smart
environment to design their own learning experiences.</p>
