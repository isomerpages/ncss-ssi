The technology and the infrastructure found in SSI’s classrooms are based on the SMILE concept: S- Simplicity, M- Mobility, I- Intelligence, L- Learning collaboration and E- Empowerment. This creates a smart learning environment that allows for a more interactive and productive learning experience for our learners.

Components of SSI’s smart learning environment include gadgets like a “digital” pen that captures, records and digitalises ones handwriting in real time and an auto-tracking camera that senses and follows a Adult Educator’s (AE) movements in order to record a lecture for uploading and sharing in real time.

In SSI, both our learners and AEs are empowered to leverage on our smart environment to design their own learning experiences.
