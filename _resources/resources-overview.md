SSI provides a wide array of resources for Social Service Agencies (SSAs) and social service professionals. Through the resources provided by SSI, SSAs may develop the capabilities of staff members and this will in turn help build capability throughout the sector due to the sharing of knowledge and expertise. Interested SSAs can also collaborate with SSI in order to improve our current suite of resources. Write to us through <socialserviceinstitute@ncss.gov.sg> if you would like to provide us with any ideas, comments and suggestions on the current suite of resources provided by SSI.
