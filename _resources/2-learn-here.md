## LearnHere
LearnHere is an online platform that hosts a variety of learning based content. It was created to complement formal classroom trainings and provide an online portal for social service professionals to access learning-based content readily while balancing the requirements of a full time job.

Specifically, LearnHere offers both e-Learning that is hosted on our [Learning Cloud](https://learningcloud.sg/pages/external-dashboard.jsf;ilp_JSESSIONID=F1095C87D03086A2672664730D6D7D46?dashboardId=1) platform and blended learning content, which involves a blend of more than one type of learning (e.g. a blend of traditional face-to-face learning in the classroom and online learning).

Through a blended learning approach, learning can happen before a learner enters the classroom, allowing for more effective use of classroom time for deeper discussions with our adult educators and their peers.
