<h2>Youth Worker, Gracehaven, Salvation Army</h2>
<p>At a loss for what to do after his ‘O’ Levels, Timothy found inspiration
in a tough period he went through during his teens. “Looking back on that
time, I realised that I had the innate desire to help others”, he shared.
This made him decide to pursue an education in the social services, an
area in which he felt he could fulfil his aspirations, and give back to
the community. In spite of being questioned by a friend who felt that he
would be able to donate much more earnings to charity and worthy causes
as a successful businessman, Timothy felt that a greater joy lay in being
able to help others succeed. “I feel a great sense of satisfaction in helping
others to accomplish great things and succeed in life. This is my personal
motivation,” he affirmed.</p>

<p><em>"Do not be afraid of change. Others can give you a second chance to change, but you must give yourself a second chance too, to be the change."</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Advising those who wish to join the social service sector, Timothy shares,
“You need to be able to have empathy towards others, relating to them to
help them overcome their struggles. Have a lot of passion and patience,
be sensitive to what they feel and say, andask the right questions. From
there, it’s a gradual build up of trust, and the relationship will blossom.”</p>
<p>With this trust, Timothy has found himself on track to achieving his fundamental
hope of becoming a beacon of light to illuminate the way for his clients.</p>
