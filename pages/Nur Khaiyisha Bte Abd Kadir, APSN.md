<h2>Special Needs Teacher, APSN</h2>
<p>Khaiyisha would like to tell those thinking of joining the social service
sector, or who would like to give back to society in some way to “Go for
it” if you have that voice or feeling in your heart. “Start from that small
fire,” she asserts.</p>
<p>Certainly, that fire is what has propelled her onto an unexpected, yet
meaningful, mid-career switch that she is now confidently flourishing in.</p>
<p>Before becoming a teacher at the Association for Persons with Special
Needs (APSN), Khaiyisha was teaching in a mainstream school for about nine
years.</p>
<p>Throughout her time there, she came across students facing challenges
at school, which made her contemplate the assistance they—and others like
them— would require in order to succeed. In her words, something “clicked
in her mind”, and she realised she could do something more to help them
reach their full potential.</p>
<p>In her last two years teaching at a mainstream school, Khaiyisha was also
studying for her Degree in Counselling. Inspired by a lecturer’s advice,
and through exploring options to upgrade her professional skills, Khaiyisha
eventually enrolled for an Advanced Certificate in Supported Employment
(ACSE), offered by SSI. She was the only applicant not nominated by a employer,
yet the ACSE was exactly what she was looking for. Khaiyisha gained industry
know-how on how to support students with disabilities and build up their
employment capability. Sharing by other professionals with diverse backgrounds
in the course, also allowed her a better view of the disability sub sector
in Singapore.</p>

<p><strong>"Just keep going. Always believe that things will be better. One day, everything will fall in place. This is what is keeping me going."</strong>
</p>
<p>An incredible opportunity to work with APSN presented itself to Khaiyisha,
midway through the course. Although her decision to enrol in the ACSE course
was purely to improve herself, it was also her chance to put all her learning
to use. Thus, Khaiyisha decided to seize the opportunity,and applied for
the position at APSN.</p>
<p>The knowledge she gained from her experience with ACSE has helped her
to become more effective and intelligent in working with students with
a diversity of special needs. She spends her day teaching personal management
skills to her students and helping them to strengthen their character,
learn how to communicate effectively with others and behave appropriately
in public.</p>
<p>Khaiyisha finds her work very rewarding, especially when her students
achieve particular milestones. She is especially proud of them when they
tell her they managed to say “Hello” to their neighbour, or when they show
her selfies they take with their family.</p>
<p>Still, Khaiyisha is far from resting on her laurels and wants to learn
more from the abundance of information and views out there.</p>
<p>“Often, we think we know enough of a particular subject…But we do not
know what we do not know. For instance, we might think we know how to talk
to people, yet there are more ways to engage others in conversation than
the ways we already know. That’s why I am motivated to keep on learning
to find ways to impart various techniques to my students, and provide them
to the skills and support they need to succeed in life,” she shares.</p>
<p>One can be sure that Khaiyisha will continue to sharpen her skills and
acquire more knowledge to benefit her students and her work.</p>
