## Mr Timothy Chua Kim Seng, Youth Worker, Gracehaven, Salvation Army

At a loss for what to do after his ‘O’ Levels, Timothy found inspiration in a tough period he went through during his teens. “Looking back on that time, I realised that I had the innate desire to help others”, he shared. This made him decide to pursue an education in the social services, an area in which he felt he could fulfil his aspirations, and give back to the community.  In spite of being questioned by a friend who felt that he would be able to donate much more earnings to charity and worthy causes as a successful businessman, Timothy felt that a greater joy lay in being able to help others succeed. “I feel a great sense of satisfaction in helping others to accomplish great things and succeed in life. This is my personal motivation,” he affirmed.

Advising those who wish to join the social service sector, Timothy shares, “You need to be able to have empathy towards others, relating to them to help them overcome their struggles. Have a lot of passion and patience, be sensitive to what they feel and say, andask the right questions. From there, it’s a gradual build up of trust, and the relationship will blossom.”
 
With this trust, Timothy has found himself on track to achieving his fundamental hope of becoming a beacon of light to illuminate the way for his clients.
