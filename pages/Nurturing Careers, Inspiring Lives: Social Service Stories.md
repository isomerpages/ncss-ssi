‘Nurturing Careers, Inspiring Lives’ showcases the stories of individuals from different walks of life whose lives have been transformed by their desire to learn and grow. Through the different chapters, you will be able to see how SSI has empowered each individual to pursue their dreams in the social service sector through our various courses and by serving as a learning partner.  

This book was launched by the Minister of Education, Mr Ong Ye Kung, during SSI's Graduation and Awards Ceremony 2016. The book’s foreword is contributed by Mr Tan Chuan-Jin, the current Speaker of Parliament and captures the importance of continued learning and development in order to meet the needs of the evolving social service sector.
