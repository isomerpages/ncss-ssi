## Mr Pathnapuram Manoj, Assistant Director (Resource & Training Centre), AWWA Ltd

Joining the Sun Ray scheme represented a new beginning for Manoj. It provided him with the opportunity to further grow his expertise after 15 years as a speech therapist under a single organisation.
 
As a speech therapist, Manoj worked the ground closely, connecting directly with beneficiaries and frontline personnel. This earned him valuable know-how and proficiency, and the accumulation of knowledge and experience serves him well today, in his current leadership role as a trainer at Sun Ray. Well aware of the challenges faced by those working in the field, he is able to provide the best support and training needed to empower those on the frontline to help more, and help better.
 
Manoj’s aptitude for management has not gone unnoticed. He is currently a Social Service Fellow, a position that is jointly awarded by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) and NCSS. The Fellowship brings together social service professionals from diverse specialisations, tapping  on their expertise to move the sector forward.
 
Big on learning, Manoj also recently completed the “Leadership Milestone Programme – Lead Manager” course. The intensive programme enhanced his existing abilities through several approaches, such as developing a greater self-awareness, and learning strategies to enable greater team effectiveness and client focus. It also equipped him with the skills to facilitate a culture of innovation by implementing organisational vision and values.
 
Most importantly, Manoj was able to connect with other social service professionals through attending the course, and now participates in authentic conversations with them. Allowing everyone to support eachother in moving ahead as leaders. He shares, “The Leadership Milestone Programme is aligned to the competencies required in our sector. It is a win-win situation for us, when we can work collectively in partnership with the stakeholders and clients to build a resilient society.”
 
A lifelong learner and one who is always ready to draw on the strengths of those around him to create a better outcome for all, Manoj has commented that, “Learning and leadership are not linear. They have their peaks and troughs. When we learn, we realise that some of the learning in the past is not the same anymore. We need to have the constant curiosity  to learn and be aware of what is new, and also the readiness to unlearn when it doesn’t work anymore.”
 
At the end of the day, what motivates Manoj is knowing that his efforts have an impact on clients. He thrives off the feedback they give, and it is the little “impacts” he create that keep him going. His experience of life, joy and service in this purposeful career, can be summed up in this inspiring quote from writer Rabrindranath Tagore that he shares with us:
