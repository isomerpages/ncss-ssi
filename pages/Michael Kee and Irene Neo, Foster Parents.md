<h2>Foster Parents' Experience of Fostering in Singapore</h2>
<p>The combination of Irene and Michael’s individual strengths are what help
create a loving and conducive environment to foster a child. With her aptitude
for logic and organisation, Irene focuses on establishing a comfortable
routine that the child can easily adjust to, while Michael’s vision and
optimism creates room for the child’s growth and potential to blossom.</p>
<p>The camaraderie between them and their foster child during the interview
was effortless and natural. Yet the decision to foster wasn’t always so
clear. When Michael first discussed with his wife the idea of fostering
3 years ago, they decided they weren’t fully ready yet. They had many doubts
about their capability to undertake the endeavour, and it was a few months
before they submitted their application to the Ministry of Social and Family
Development (MSF). Once the process was set in motion, an assessment officer
arrived at their door to carry out home visits and detailed interviews
with the couple. Upon receiving approval to be foster parents, Michael
and Irene also attended the mandatory 10 weeks of foundation and intermediate
courses conducted by SSI to prepare for their new roles as foster parents.</p>
<p>The training equipped them with essential knowledge, such as a better
understanding of the behavioural and emotional aspects of a child and what
happens when a child is taken from their immediate family to be placed
with others. Other foster parents were also present to share their best
practices and the challenging situations they faced. “We became more confident
after undergoing the training. It helped our ability to understand the
child, and gave us helpful methods to bond with, encourage and teach the
child.”</p>
<p>Presently, both Irene and Michael are also part of foster parent chatgroups,
where valuable fostering tips are exchanged. They’ve picked up tips on
managing a child’s tantrum with a simple change of words to convey a more
effective message. And instead of using the negative-sounding command,
“go to the naughty corner”, a more positive outcome can be achieved by
simply replacing the key words with “thinking chair”.</p>

<p><em><sup>"Seeing her smile, being so happy and healthy – that is one of the greatest joys I’ve experienced. She keeps running over wanting to talk to me, so I know I’ve won her heart."</sup></em>
</p>
<p>While there are challenges they have yet to face with their foster child
who has been with them since April 2017, both husband and wife are motivated
to stay ready by keeping themselves updated, “Technology advances too rapidly
nowadays. We used to play and socialise at the playground. Now, it is all
through social media. We have to keep up with the times and master the
technology to facilitate practical learning with the child.”</p>
<p>They’ve also had to unlearn some of the knowledge from their own childhoods,
along the way, and pick up new approaches to interacting with children.</p>
<p>Instead of the more authoritarian style of parenting that they grew up
knowing, today’s parenting is all about establishing a more beneficial
parenting method. So far, Irene and Michael have found that their dedication
has yielded them significant milestones in their journey with their foster
child. One instance is how their child used to pile her plate with a portion
larger than an adult’s, overeating to the point of a bloated stomach. Michael
and Irene taught her to begin with a small portion first, and ask for second
helpings if she was still hungry. They role-played the scenario a few times,
with Michael finishing his meal first, then asking his wife for more food.
This helped assure her and resolved her food-hoarding habit.</p>
<p>Through their constant prompts of: “What are the magic words?” and “What
must you say first?”, Michael and Irene’s foster child is also learning
to express her needs and appreciation in an appropriate manner by saying
“please” and “thank you”.</p>
<p>Both Michael and Irene have imparted their values and knowledge to their
foster child and their devotion and passion has transformed their home
into a sanctuary of affection and warmth. They hope more parents can come
forward to experience the joys and love a foster child can bring to the
home. By providing foster children with a loving home, it can help them
to develop into confident and responsible future leaders.</p>
