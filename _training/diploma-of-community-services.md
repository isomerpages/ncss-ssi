### **Overview**

The Diploma of Community Services is a qualification developed by the Centre for Disability Studies (CDS) with a specific focus on person-centred practice in the disability sector. It is developed based on the values of inclusion, and on John O'Brien's five valued experiences – community participation, promoting choice, supporting contribution, encouraging valued social roles and community presence. There are a total of six themed modules in this diploma programme.  
  
This diploma was developed due to changes in contemporary disability service delivery and the demand for practitioners in the disability field to be fully trained and equipped to deliver person-centred services.
