## Mental Health Programmes
All persons with mental health issues are supported to be re-integrated into the community to cope better in life. To ensure a seamless recovery journey, a spectrum of rehabilitation and support services to enable persons with mental health issues and their caregivers is available on hand. 

The [Peer Support Specialist Programme](peer-support-specialist-programme) aims to provide opportunities for persons with mental health issues to leverage on their lived experience of recovery to support others in their recovery journey in a formal and structured training as well as equipping them with competencies as a Peer Support Specialist.
