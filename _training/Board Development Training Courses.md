<h4><strong>FAQ</strong></h4>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>What is the difference between the former SGOOD programme compared to this refreshed version?</strong>
<br>
<br>SGOOD's enhanced curriculum and flexible delivery approach have been redesigned
to maximise learning impact and accessibility for both aspiring and current
non-profit Directors.</p>
<p>The refreshed SGOOD has been developed in accordance with evolving needs
of the non-profit sector, with a focus on practical implementation, sustainability,
and long-term impact. Topics in SGOOD have expanded to cover emerging trends,
digital transformation, innovation, counter-financing of terrorism, service
delivery effectiveness and forward-looking approaches to governance.</p>
<p>SGOOD is now offered through blended learning (e-learning, in-person and
webinar sessions) to enhance the accessibility and learning experience
for all aspiring and current non-profit Directors.

updated with the latest developments in the board and non-profit space,
you are highly encouraged to attend the programme.</p>
