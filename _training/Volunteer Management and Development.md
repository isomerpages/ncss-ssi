<h3><strong>Learning &amp; Development Roadmap for Volunteer Managers</strong></h3>
<p>Volunteer managers are key enablers in engaging volunteers to augment
the manpower capabilities of Social Service Agencies (SSAs). To play this
vital role and prepare volunteer managers for the emerging trends in the
social service sector’s transformation, NCSS developed the <a href="https://go.gov.sg/ldrpublication" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Learning &amp; Development Roadmap (LDR)</a> in
consultation with the sector and endorsed by senior management of SSAs,
to uplift the capabilities and increase ownership in the professional development
of volunteer managers.</p>
<p>The LDR provides guidance on the skills and competencies required to perform
effectively and optimise volunteer resources in meeting the needs of service
users. It shows potential development pathways and learning opportunities
as volunteer managers plan towards the longer-term goal of serving and
growing with the sector. Besides volunteer managers, SSAs’ management and
human resource practitioners may also use the LDR as a guide to recruit
and develop their volunteer managers.</p><a class="isomer-image-wrapper" href="https://go.gov.sg/ldrpublication"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Mr Christian Chao" src="/images/training/volunteer/Mr_Christian_Chao.jpg"></a>
