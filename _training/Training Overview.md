<h2>SSI's Learning Philosophy</h2>
<p>SSI'S learning philosophy is guided by the Education Innovation (EI) initiative.
This initiative is based on the following beliefs:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>In addition to classroom learning, informal and social learning is as
important for the development of specific skills and expertise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learning can happen anytime and anywhere</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technology is a key enabler in the learning process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of this initiative, SSI is transforming learning in the social
service and non-profit sector through the use of various new learning methodologies
that have been made possible by technology. This has resulted in the creation
of new and enriching learning experiences.</p>
<h2>Social Service Training courses</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://iltms.ssi.gov.sg/registration#/Course" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">training courses</a> offered
by SSI can be segregated into ten course categories. Although each course
category is segregated into specific sub-sectors or fields within the social
service sector, learners should adopt a horizontal learning approach and
undertake relevant courses across different course categories to have a
well balanced set of skills for their job role.</p>
