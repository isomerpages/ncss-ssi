## Training
SSI'S learning philosophy is guided by the Education Innovation (EI) initiative. This initiative is based on the following beliefs:
- In addition to classroom learning, informal and social learning is as important for the development of specific skills and expertise.
- Learning can happen anytime and anywhere
- Technology is a key enabler in the learning process.

As part of this initiative, SSI is transforming learning in the social service and non-profit sector through the use of various new learning methodologies that have been made possible by technology. This has resulted in the creation of new and enriching learning experiences.

### Training Programmes
The training programmes offered by SSI can be segregated into ten course categories as shown below. Although each course category is segregated into specific sub-sectors or fields within the social service sector, learners should adopt a horizontal learning approach and undertake relevant courses across different course categories to have a well balanced set of skills for their job role.
