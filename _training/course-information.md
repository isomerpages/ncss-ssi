## Course Administration

As part of SSIâ€™s Education Innovation initiative, we will leverage on technology to enrich the learning experience of our learners. This includes equipping classrooms with smart technology facilities and adopting innovative teaching pedagogies through the use of online platforms. SSI will also be progressively converting our courses into a blended learning style to incorporate online components such as quizzes and supplementary reading materials before the classroom session. Some of the changes that our learners will experience are as shown below.

-   Learners will receive access to online courseware instead of printed materials.
    
-   Learners will complete an online course evaluation.
    
-   Learners will receive an e-certificate after attending their SSI courses. For details on how to download your e-certification follow this  [link](/images/faq/Download eCertificate V3.pdf){:target="_blank"}
