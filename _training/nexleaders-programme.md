SSI and [Meta Consulting](https://meta.com.sg/){:target="_blank"}, a premier leadership development company with experience over the last 27 years, have created a tailor-made leadership development programme for the social service sector, using the [NEXLeaders.com](https://nexleaders.com/){:target="_blank"} suite of mobile, micro-learning courses, powered by the [Gnowbe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL55Xl-G72w&ab_channel=Gnowbe){:target="_blank"} learning platform.

From 1,375 surveys received:  
* 95% completed all the required courses
* 85% acquired new knowledge/skills
* 87% could use what they learned at work
* 85% found it useful for personal development and learning
* 90% found the Gnowbe learning platform very user-friendly

Because of the effectiveness of the NEXLeaders leadership program, we are embarking on the third phase of this partnership to extend these benefits to more Social Service Agencies. 

This one-year initiative was jointly developed to overcome social distancing barriers and work from home (WFH) challenges. NEXLeaders.com enables staff to learn on-the-go, anytime, anywhere through bite-size content, with a choice of more than 60 courses from value-based industrial experts.
