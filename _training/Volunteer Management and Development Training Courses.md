<h3><strong>Learning &amp; Development Roadmap for Volunteer Management Practitioners</strong></h3>
<p>Volunteer Management Practitioners (VMPs) are key enablers in engaging
volunteers to augment the manpower capabilities of Social Service Agencies
(SSAs). To play this vital role and prepare VMPs for the emerging trends
in the social service sector’s transformation, NCSS developed the Learning
&amp; Development Roadmap (LDR) in consultation with the sector and endorsed
by senior management of SSAs, to uplift the capabilities and increase ownership
in the professional development of VMPs.</p>
<p>The LDR provides guidance on the skills and competencies required to perform
effectively and optimise volunteer resources in meeting the needs of service
users. It shows potential development pathways and learning opportunities
as VMPs plan towards the longer-term goal of serving and growing with the
sector. Besides VMPs, SSAs’ management and human resource practitioners
may also use the LDR as a guide to recruit and develop their VMPs.</p>
