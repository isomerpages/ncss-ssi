## Learning &amp; Development Roadmap for Volunteer Management Practitioners
Volunteer Management Practitioners (VMPs) are key enablers in engaging volunteers to augment the manpower capabilities of Social Service Agencies (SSAs). To play this vital role and prepare VMPs for the emerging trends in the social service sector’s transformation, NCSS developed the Learning &amp; Development Roadmap (LDR) in consultation with the sector and endorsed by senior management of SSAs, to uplift the capabilities and increase ownership in the professional development of VMPs.

The LDR provides guidance on the skills and competencies required to perform effectively and optimise volunteer resources in meeting the needs of service users. It shows potential development pathways and learning opportunities as VMPs plan towards the longer-term goal of serving and growing with the sector. Besides VMPs, SSAs’ management and human resource practitioners may also use the LDR as a guide to recruit and develop their VMPs.

![A comment about Learning &amp; Development Roadmap by president of loving heart multi service centre and volunteer centre, Assoc Prof Teng Su Ching, "Social service sector transformation comes fast and furious. Emerging trends quickly become the current practice especially in social service. volunteer management practitioners (VMP) must be equipped not just with the right skills and knowledge to help guide this transformation, but also with core skills that enable them to take a transdisciplinary view of social service."](/images/training/volunteer/L_D%20Quote%20Banner_03.jpg)

## LDR Self-assessment Tool 
The accompanying Self-assessment Tool (SAT) to the LDR helps VMPs to identify their proficiency gaps and relevant training courses (including Social Service Institutes’ (SSI) courses), to further strengthen their capabilities so as to perform effectively in their roles.
