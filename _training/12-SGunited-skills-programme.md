### Overview

The SGUnited Jobs & Skills Package was launched by DPM Heng Swee Keat on 26 May 2020 to support an estimated 100,000 Singaporeans whose livelihoods have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the initiatives under this package is the SGUS programme, which will provide job and traineeship opportunities to jobseekers to help them acquire the skillsets and capabilities needed to access expanded employment opportunities in both the private and public sector.

Over 40,000 jobs will be provided through this ‘Train-and-Place’ model and all courses under the SGUnited Skills (SGUS) programme are modularised to be industry-relevant and certifiable and were designed in partnership with employers in the public and private sector. For learners who lack the basic skillsets required to access SGUS courses, bridging modules in basic literacy, numeracy, digital literacy and basic financial planning will be provided.

### How Do We Help?

If you are a Singaporean or a Singapore permanent resident who is a job seeker with two or more years of working experience, we will equip you with the relevant skills to assume roles in the social service sector. Refer to the respective programmes for the entry requirement and the targeted job roles at the end of the programme.

Each programme will take around six to eight months to complete, this includes a three months internship period in a social service agency (SSA). Career advisory and support will be provided for job placements upon completion of the programme where necessary.

The government has subsidised most programmes by over 95%. However,  you may still use your SkillsFuture Credits to offset the cost of the SGUS programmes and you will also be receiving $1,200 per month as a training allowance if you maintain a 75% attendance during the six to seven months of each programme. However, this amount will be pro-rated if you have already received other subsidies. For example, recipients of the Covid19 Support Grant (CSG) and the Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme (SIRS) will only receive a top up of $400 and $200 respectively.
