<h3><strong>Course Administration</strong></h3>
<p>As part of SSI’s Education Innovation initiative, we leverage on technology
to enrich the learning experience of our learners. This includes equipping
classrooms with smart technology facilities and adopting innovative teaching
pedagogies through the use of online platforms. SSI has also converted
some of our courses into a blended learning style to incorporate online
components such as quizzes and supplementary reading materials before the
classroom session. Some of the changes that our learners will experience
are as shown below.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Learners will receive access to online courseware instead of printed materials.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learners will complete an online course evaluation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learners will receive an e-certificate after attending their SSI courses.
You may refer to the learners’ user guide on the <a href="https://www.ssi.gov.sg/resources/learnhere/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">downloading of e-certificates</a>.</p>
