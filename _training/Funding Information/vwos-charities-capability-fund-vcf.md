**Eligibility Criteria**  

  To be eligible for VCF, you must:

  -   Achieve at least 75 per cent attendance; and
  -   Be certified competent in all assessment components  

  Staff from NCSS member Social Service Organisations and MSF-funded agencies who are Employment Pass, Work Permit or S Pass holders are also eligible for VCF funding.  

  However, there is no VCF pre-approved training grant for customised training session(s) for your organisation. Eligible NPOs and Social Service Organisations can  [apply directly to VCF](https://app.ncss.gov.sg/?PartnerId=https%3a%2f%2fe-services.ncss.gov.sg%2fLogin%2fVLoginReturn&targeturl=%2f){:target="_blank"}      for funding, and will be required to pay full course fees to SSI.   


**Funding Scheme**

|**Type of Courses** |**VCF Funding**  |**Application Procedures**|
|--|--|--|
|SSI WSQ and non-WSQ certifiable courses.|Up to 60% of course fees capped at $600 at a cap of $192 per day.|Submit your VCF application online via the VWO Corner in compliance with the VCF Evaluation Panel dates and submission deadlines. Applications must be submitted at least one month before the course start date.|
|--|--|--|
|SSI governance and management courses.|Up to 60% of course fees capped at $700.|Submit your VCF application directly to SSI.|
|--|--|--|

In the event that you fail to meet the attendance/assessment requirements and terms and conditions for VCF funding eligibility, you will be liable for the full course fees.   

|For Example for a two-day “Building Emotional Resilience in Caregiving” course fee that equates to $650/pax (before funding)|
|--|
|Calculation: <br> 60% of course fee ($650) = $390 <br> $192 per day x 2 days = $384 <br> VCF funds which amount is lower, which in this case is $384, and which is below the cap of $600.<br> There the course fee after funding = $600 - $384 = $266 |
