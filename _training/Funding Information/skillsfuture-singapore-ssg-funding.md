<h3><strong>What is SSG Funding: SSG Funding Principle</strong></h3>
<p>SSI is a CET Centre that offers Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ)
and non-WSQ courses at subsidised rates. Both Singaporeans and PRs are
eligible for course subsidies. Employers can also tap on absentee payroll
support funding for employer-sponsored training.</p>
<h4>SkillsFuture Course Fee Funding</h4>
<p>If you are a self-sponsored trainee, you may visit <a href="https://www.skillsfuture.gov.sg/funding-individuals" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SSG Course Fee Funding page</a> for
more information.</p>
<h4>SSG Funding Scheme for Training of Organisation-Sponsored Volunteers</h4>
<p>If you are a volunteer, you can qualify for the SSG Funding Scheme for
Training of Organisation-Sponsored Volunteers as long as you and your organisation
fulfil all of the eligibility criteria stated below. Volunteers who are
not Singaporeans, PRs or LTVP+ holders can apply directly to VCF for funding.</p>
