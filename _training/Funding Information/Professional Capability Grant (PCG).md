|For Example for a two-day “Building Emotional Resilience in Caregiving” course fee that equates to $650/pax (before funding)|
|--|
|Calculation: <br> 60% of course fee ($650) = $390 <br> $192 per day x 2 days = $384 <br> PCG funds which amount is lower, which in this case is $384, and which is below the cap of $700.<br> There the course fee after funding = $650 - $384 = $266 |
